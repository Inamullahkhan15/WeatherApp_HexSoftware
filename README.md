A next-generation Weather Application built for the internship evaluation. This app goes beyond basic temperature reporting to provide real-time, actionable life insights using modern Android development practices.

## 🚀 Key Professional Highlights
- **Architecture**: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) with Clean Architecture principles.
- **Tech Stack**: 100% Jetpack Compose, Kotlin Coroutines, Flow, Hilt (Dependency Injection), Retrofit, Room Database, and Coil.
- **Dynamic UI**: Real-time background changes based on weather conditions (Day, Night, Rain, Clouds) with auto-adapting text contrast.

## 🌟 Advanced Lifestyle Features (Beyond Basic Weather)
These unique features were implemented to demonstrate a consumer-centric approach to software development:

1.  **🩺 Health & Bio-Weather Portfolio**
    - Integrated **Air Quality Index (AQI)** for real-time pollution monitoring.
    - Intelligent health alerts for **Joint Pain** (Cold/High Humidity), **Migraine/Sinus** (Low Pressure), and **Heatstroke warnings**.

2.  **👕 Smart Wardrobe Assistant**
    - An AI-driven clothing advisor that recommends outfits (T-shirt, Jacket, Heavy Coat) based on live temperature.
    - Automatic **Umbrella Reminders** and wind-safety alerts.

3.  **📅 Event & Activity Planner**
    - Dynamic "Success Score" for daily activities like **Cricket/Sports**, **Outdoor Dining**, **Picnic**, and even **Laundry Day** feasibility.

4.  **☀️ Vitamin D & Sunlight Tracker**
    - Calculated sun exposure time required for daily vitamin D based on cloud cover and UV factors.
    - Real-time **Sunrise/Sunset** tracking.

5.  **🤳 Hyper-Local Community Reporting**
    - A crowdsourced weather feature allowing users to report local conditions (e.g., "Raining in my street") stored in a local **Room Database**.

## 🛠️ Technical Specifications
- **Reactive Data**: Using `StateFlow` and `flatMapLatest` for real-time community report updates.
- **Custom Graphics**: Hand-drawn **Hourly Forecast Graphs** with dynamic switching between Temperature, Humidity, and Wind metrics.
- **Live Updates**: Implemented a **Live Clock Engine** that ensures the UI reflects the exact current local time alongside weather data.
- **Unit Flexibility**: Seamless toggle between **Metric (°C)** and **Imperial (°F)** with full recalibration of all lifestyle logic thresholds.

## 📸 How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Add your OpenWeatherMap API key in `Constants.kt`.
3. Build and run on any Android device (API 26+ recommended).
